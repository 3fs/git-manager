manager
=======

manager is a collection of git extensions providing high-level repository operations for a simple branching model.


A word of advice
----------------

manager is in active development, current state is not suitable for active "production" use. In other words, there is no guarantee it works as advertised at this point :) Regardless, contributions are more then welcome, see below for details.


Installation
------------

For the time being, it is possible to install manger manually only.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidkuridza/git-manager.git
$ cd git-manager
$ make install
```

By default, manager will be installed to `/usr/local`. It can be installed to a different location by using PREFIX explicitly:

```
$ PREFIX=/opt/local make install
```


Contributing
------------
Contributions are always welcome. You make my life easier by sending your contributions through GitHub pull requests.

Due to time constraints, I am not always able to respond as quickly as I would like. Please do not take delays personally and feel free to remind me here if you feel that I forgot to respond.

Since I tend to keep all my repositories neat and tidy, I hold the right to alter the contributions to match the standards, NOT to take credit for your work.
